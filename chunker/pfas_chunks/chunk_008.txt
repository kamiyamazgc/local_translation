Compliance with this rule is estimated to cost approximately \$1.5 billion annually. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has dedicated \$9 billion through to help communities impacted by PFAS pollution in drinking water. In addition, another \$12 billion in Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding is available to communities to make general drinking water improvements, including addressing PFAS chemicals. Estimated costs include water system monitoring, communicating with customers, and – if necessary – installing treatment technologies.

# **Implementation and Funding**

The rule is achievable and implementable. Drinking water utilities will be able to implement these new requirements as control technologies exist and are in use today. Water treatment technologies exist to remove PFAS from drinking water including granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange systems. EPA's final rule does not dictate how water systems remove these contaminants. The rule is flexible, allowing systems to determine the best solutions for their community. Public water systems can choose from multiple proven treatment options. In some cases, systems can close contaminated wells or obtain a new uncontaminated source of drinking water.

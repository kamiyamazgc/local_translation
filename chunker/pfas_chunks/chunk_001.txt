# **PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation**

#### **Introduction**

Safe drinking water is fundamental to healthy people and thriving communities. EPA believes that all people in the United States should have access to clean, safe drinking water and has been delivering on the promise to protect communities from the harmful effects of toxic substances, including carcinogens. PFAS are a series of man-made chemical compounds that persist in the environment for long periods of time. They are often called "forever chemicals." For decades PFAS chemicals have been used in industry and consumer products such as nonstick cookware, waterproof clothing, and stain resistant furniture. These chemicals have been important for certain industries and uses. And the latest science shows that these chemicals are harmful to our health.

PFAS exposure over a long period of time can cause cancer and other serious illnesses that decrease quality of life or result in death. PFAS exposure during critical life stages such as pregnancy or early childhood can also result in adverse health impacts. EPA's responsibility through the Safe Drinking Water Act is to protect people's drinking water, and the agency is taking action to protect public health by establishing nationwide, legally enforceable drinking water limits for several well-researched PFAS chemicals and reduce PFAS exposure for approximately 100 million Americans served by public drinking water systems.
## **The Rule**


As the lead federal agency responsible for protecting America's drinking water, EPA is using the best available science on PFAS to set national standards. PFAS can often be found together in water and in varying combinations as mixtures. Decades of research shows mixtures of different chemicals can have additive health effects, even if the individual chemicals are each present at lower levels.

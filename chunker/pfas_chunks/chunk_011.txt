If you are concerned about PFAS in drinking water, there are key actions you can take. People who are concerned about PFAS in their drinking water should first contact their drinking water utility to find out more about their drinking water, including what contaminants may be present, if the utility is monitoring for PFAS, what the levels are, and to see whether any actions are being taken.

If you remain concerned after talking to your utility, then consider using or installing in-home water treatment (e.g., filters) that is certified to lower the levels of PFAS in your water and/or contact your health care provider as well as your state or local health department. You can find more information about water filters that help reduce PFAS [here.](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-04/water-filter-fact-sheet.pdf) If you get your water from a home drinking water well, then EPA recommends you conduct regular testing. If PFAS are found, you can take steps to lower the levels of PFAS. For more visit EPA's website [here.](https://www.epa.gov/pfas/meaningful-and-achievable-steps-you-can-take-reduce-your-risk)

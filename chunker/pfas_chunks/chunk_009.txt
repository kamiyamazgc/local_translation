There is unprecedented funding for drinking water systems impacted by PFAS and other emerging contaminants to provide safe water to communities. We know that PFAS pollution can have a disproportionate impact on small, disadvantaged, and rural communities, and there is federal funding available specifically for these water systems. With today's announcement of the rule, EPA is also announcing nearly \$1 billion for states and territories, through the [Emerging Contaminants in Small or Disadvantaged Communities Grant Program,](https://www.epa.gov/dwcapacity/emerging-contaminants-ec-small-or-disadvantaged-communities-grant-sdc) which can be used for initial testing and treatment at both public water systems and to help owners of private wells address PFAS contamination. The nearly \$1 billion announced today is part of the dedicated \$9 billion of Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding for communities with drinking water impacted by PFAS and other emerging contaminants. An additional \$12 billion in Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding is available to communities to make general drinking water improvements, including addressing PFAS pollution. Another option for PFAS funding is the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program, a federal loan program at EPA that provides low-cost, flexible funding to communities for water infrastructure projects, including projects to address PFAS. WIFIA funding is available year-round, so communities can request financing on their schedule.

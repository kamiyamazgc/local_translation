While the Samsung Tri-Fold will likely be shown in July, the actual launch is expected in October 2025. This approach is similar to how Samsung handled the launch of the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year. This phone was teased at a big event but was released a few months later. Alongside these devices, Samsung may also tease a new product called Project Moohan, which is an Android XR headset. Like the Tri-Fold, it could also be released around October 2025. The Galaxy Tri-Fold is already listed on several certification platforms. It is also rumored to share several components similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 7, like the hinge mechanism, speaker drivers, and cutouts. This could help reduce costs and speed up production. Since the Tri-Fold will likely be made in limited quantities, it might be a more exclusive product. Aside from this, Samsung is now accepting free reservations for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7. If you sign up early, you’ll get a $50 credit, 3X reward points, and up to $1,150 in trade-in savings. How to reserve Galaxy Z Fold7, Flip7 and get free $50 Samsung Credit in the US

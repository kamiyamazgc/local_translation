However, details about the Galaxy S26 remain speculative. With its launch expected in early 2026, no solid leaks confirm a camera design change yet. Still, Samsung’s responsiveness to feedback on the Z Fold 7 is a promising sign. Phones
Galaxy S26 Ultra could drop S Pen slot for a reason many fans might support
Thinking of a battery upgrade in Samsung’s next Ultra. Your wish might come true in 2026. Samsung is reportedly considering a battery upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Ultra and beyond, but it would come at the cost of the S Pen slot. Weibo leaker claims there’s a 50-50 chance that Samsung might abandon the S Pen slot from its future Ultra flagships, probably the Galaxy S26 Ultra. The company is apparently mulling over utilizing this space for battery and practical sensors. Recently, a report revealed that the Galaxy S27 Ultra may remove the stylus slot. However, the new input suggests that the Galaxy S25 Ultra might render the last Samsung flagship with a built-in S Pen inside the body. The removal of this silo will prove a boon for Samsung. The phone will have some space vacated that can be used for a battery upgrade, which has been pending for years. Also, more practical sensors would be installed for the user’s benefit. We expect a 5 to 10% battery capacity boost in case Samsung goes ahead with slot removal in the Galaxy S26 Ultra. The company won’t approach a radical upgrade just to satisfy user demand amid competition from Chinese brands.

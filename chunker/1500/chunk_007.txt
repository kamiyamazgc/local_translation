While the Galaxy Fold 7 may still sell well even with a higher price, many believe the Flip 7 should stay affordable. Some reports say Samsung will use its own chip, the Exynos 2500, in the Flip 7, which may help lower costs. Samsung wants foldable phones to make up more than 50% of its premium phone sales by 2025. But with tariffs and falling demand, keeping prices reasonable may be the only way to reach that goal. It will be a major challenge to keep prices affordable for these smartphones, mainly in the US. Samsung is set to launch the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7 soon, and we’ll get the pricing details shortly. Galaxy Z Fold7, Flip7 get a brutal price hike in Europe: Leak

Samsung’s best zoom camera sensors are skipping Galaxy phones
Samsung’s image sensor business is about to boom as Chinese phone makers are allegedly widening the use of ISOCELL zoom camera sensors. That said, the best ISOCELL zoom cameras would be seen on many phones from Chinese OEMs. While China-based OEMs are expanding the utilization of Samsung’s best zoom camera sensors, Galaxy phones will continue to skip. Exact reasons are unclear, but the biggest is that Galaxy smartphones shouldn’t go bulky like Chinese ones. Leaker IceUniverse claims that Samsung’s 200-megapixel telephoto cameras will be “widely adopted” in Chinese flagship phones. The devices will be equipped with ISOCELL HP3, ISOCELL HP5, and ISOCELL HP9 telephoto sensors.

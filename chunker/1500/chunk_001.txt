Samsung U-turns on ‘ugly’ camera ring with Z Fold 7 – Galaxy S26 next. Samsung’s new foldable phones will launch soon, and leaks suggest a major design shift. The company reportedly ditched its bold “Saturn Ring” camera design in the Galaxy Z Fold 7; could the Galaxy S26 series follow this change. A leak from @UniverseIce on X spilled the tea: fans weren’t feeling the thick camera rings, calling them tacky and cheap. Samsung listened and switched back to a sleeker design, more like the Galaxy Z Fold 5’s cleaner look. New press renders back this claim up. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 features a vertical triple camera setup with slim, polished rings. It’s a nod to Samsung’s push for a classy, minimalist vibe that shouts premium for its foldable segment. The Galaxy Z Fold 7, launching at Unpacked next month, promises a sleeker look. Early leaks showed a camera with thick, prominent rings, dubbed the “Saturn Ring Design. ” This style mirrored the S25 series’ bold camera aesthetic. The Z Fold 7’s camera redesign also ties into other upgrades. It’s expected to run on the Snapdragon 8 Elite, offering better performance and efficiency. The phone may also feature an 8-inch inner display and a 6. 5-inch cover screen. What about the Galaxy S26 series. The @UniverseIce leak hints that Samsung might abandon the “Saturn Ring” style for its 2026 flagships. The Galaxy S25 series’ thick camera rings sparked some criticism, so a redesign could be on the horizon next year.

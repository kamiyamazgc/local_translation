Will Samsung eat tariffs to keep Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 price flat in the US. Samsung is getting ready to launch its new foldable phones on July 9, 2025. The next generation foldables are expected to be thinner and smarter, thanks to improved design. But one big issue getting more attention than anything else is the price of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7, mainly in the US. There are strong signs that the price of the new Galaxy Z series could go up, especially in the US. This is because of a new plan to bring back tariffs, meaning extra taxes on smartphones made outside the United States. US President Donald Trump recently said that starting at the end of June, a 25% tariff could be added to phones made in countries like Vietnam and China. Since Samsung makes most of its phones outside the US, this could cause prices to jump for American customers. At the same time, Samsung is also worried about foldable phone sales going down. Sales of the Galaxy Flip have dropped over the last two years, and experts believe that raising the price could make things worse. In 2023, Galaxy Z Flip 6 sold only 2. 89 million units, which is a big drop from 3. 66 million the year before.

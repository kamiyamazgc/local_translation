Samsung's upcoming foldable phones (Z Fold 7 & Flip 7, launching July 2025) will feature a sleeker camera design, ditching the "Saturn Ring." The S26 series might follow suit. The S26 Ultra could remove the S Pen slot for battery and sensor upgrades. A Tri-Fold phone is also planned for a July Unpacked reveal, October launch. Prices may rise due to potential tariffs in the US. Samsung's high-end zoom camera sensors are increasingly being used by Chinese phone makers, but not yet on Galaxy devices due to design considerations.

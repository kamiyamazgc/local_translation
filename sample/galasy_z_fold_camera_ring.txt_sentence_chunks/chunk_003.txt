However, the new input suggests that the Galaxy S25 Ultra might render the last Samsung flagship with a built-in S Pen inside the body. The removal of this silo will prove a boon for Samsung. The phone will have some space vacated that can be used for a battery upgrade, which has been pending for years. Also, more practical sensors would be installed for the userâ€™s benefit. We expect a 5 to 10% battery capacity boost in case Samsung goes ahead with slot removal in the Galaxy S26 Ultra.

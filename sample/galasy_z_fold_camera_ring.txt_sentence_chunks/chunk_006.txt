This approach is similar to how Samsung handled the launch of the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year. This phone was teased at a big event but was released a few months later. Alongside these devices, Samsung may also tease a new product called Project Moohan, which is an Android XR headset. Like the Tri-Fold, it could also be released around October 2025. The Galaxy Tri-Fold is already listed on several certification platforms. It is also rumored to share several components similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 7, like the hinge mechanism, speaker drivers, and cutouts. This could help reduce costs and speed up production. Since the Tri-Fold will likely be made in limited quantities, it might be a more exclusive product. Aside from this, Samsung is now accepting free reservations for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7.

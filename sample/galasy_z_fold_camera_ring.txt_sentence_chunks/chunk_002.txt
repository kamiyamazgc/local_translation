Samsung is reportedly considering a battery upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Ultra and beyond, but it would come at the cost of the S Pen slot. Weibo leaker claims thereâ€™s a 50-50 chance that Samsung might abandon the S Pen slot from its future Ultra flagships, probably the Galaxy S26 Ultra. The company is apparently mulling over utilizing this space for battery and practical sensors. Recently, a report revealed that the Galaxy S27 Ultra may remove the stylus slot.

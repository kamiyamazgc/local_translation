Samsung’s best zoom camera sensors are skipping Galaxy phones
Samsung’s image sensor business is about to boom as Chinese phone makers are allegedly widening the use of ISOCELL zoom camera sensors. That said, the best ISOCELL zoom cameras would be seen on many phones from Chinese OEMs. While China-based OEMs are expanding the utilization of Samsung’s best zoom camera sensors, Galaxy phones will continue to skip. Exact reasons are unclear, but the biggest is that Galaxy smartphones shouldn’t go bulky like Chinese ones. Leaker IceUniverse claims that Samsung’s 200-megapixel telephoto cameras will be “widely adopted” in Chinese flagship phones. The devices will be equipped with ISOCELL HP3, ISOCELL HP5, and ISOCELL HP9 telephoto sensors. Notably, some Chinese flagships already debuted with 200MP zoom sensors from Samsung. Meanwhile, 2025 and beyond years are going to see even broader adoption, heating up the smartphone camera race. Why Samsung’s best zoom camera sensors are skipping Galaxy phones
Samsung’s best cameras aren’t seen in Galaxy phones is a long unanswered question. The company develops exclusive sensors for Galaxy flagships, but it comes much later than the rivals, who bring at least one or two generations. No one’s stopping Samsung from equipping phones with modern cameras. However, it will come at a cost: major design shifts. You may have noticed Chinese flagships boast a bulky camera module, which changes drastically each year. Samsung can’t compromise on Galaxy design philosophy to calm a portion of camera enthusiasts. The company focuses on practical improvements like elevating the photography experience that users love the most with innovative features. 200MP telephoto phones are already here, and it might be a new normal in the future. Meanwhile, the next year’s Galaxy S26 Ultra is rumored to retain almost the same camera specifications as the Galaxy S25 Ultra, leveraging AI.

In a blog post today, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo detailed his updated roadmap forecast for Apple’s headset and smart glasses markets. According to him, the company has at least seven head-worn devices in development across two product families, one coming in 2025.
According to Kuo:
Apple views head-mounted devices as the next major trend in consumer electronics. The company currently has at least seven projects in development, comprising three Vision series products and four smart glasses variants. Five of these products have confirmed development timelines, while two remain TBD.
Apple Vision Pro: spec bump in 2025, Vision Air in 2027, 2nd-gen Vision Pro in 2028
- M5 Vision Pro: Kuo believes that Apple is prepping an updated M5 Vision Pro version, which is slated to go into mass production during Q3 2025. He said other specs will remain unchanged, and estimates shipments between 150,000-200,000 until the end of 2025.
- Apple Vision Air: As for the rumored Vision Air, Kuo says that the cheaper sibling of the original Vision Pro is expected to enter mass production in Q3 2027. He says it will weigh 40% less than the original Vision Pro and use plastic and a magnesium alloy rather than glass and the current titanium alloy. Finally, it will feature a “highest-end” iPhone processor and fewer sensors.
- 2nd-gen Vision Pro: Kuo claims that a second-generation Vision Pro will feature a new design, a “Mac-class” processor, and will enter mass production in 2H-2028. He claims that it will also be cheaper and significantly lighter than the original version.
Apple Glasses: no earlier than 2027, two XR glasses underway, ‘display accessory’ on pause
- 1st-Gen Apple Glasses: Contrary to recent reports that pegged 2026 as the possible debut year, Kuo says that Apple’s first crack at a Meta Ray Ban’s smart glasses competitor is expected to enter mass production in the second quarter of 2027, with an estimated 3–5 million units shipped.
Kuo also says there will be multiple frames and materials options. Key features will include voice control, gesture recognition, photo and video recording, AI-powered environmental sensing, and audio (unclear if built-in or AirPods-dependent).
- Two XR smart glasses underway: According to the report, Apple’s first pair of glasses with a built-in display is expected to enter mass production in 2028, and will also feature gesture and voice control. The display will use Liquid Crystal on Silicon and waveguide technology.|
Kuo also notes that Apple is developing a second display-equipped model, though details on its features and launch timeline remain unclear. - Display accessory: Kuo says that work on a cable-bound accessory for the Mac and even the iPhone has been paused due to weight challenges, but still could be resumed at a later date. The product was expected to use Birdbath optics for display technology, and was slated to begin mass production in Q2 2026.
Whether by design or out of necessity, Apple is playing the long game
One interesting takeaway from Kuo’s report is that he doesn’t just expect Apple to draw attention to the smart glasses market, increasing its potential market size.
He also believes the company could leapfrog the competition with superior technology, even if its first product arrives years after others have entered what’s likely to become a crowded space:
“Apple’s entry is expected to push total market shipments for this category beyond 10 million units in 2027, marking a significant emerging trend.“
And
“Before Apple launches display-enabled smart glasses, several brands are expected to release similar products to establish early market presence. However, given the ongoing technological and design improvements needed, these products will likely remain niche offerings over the next two years.”

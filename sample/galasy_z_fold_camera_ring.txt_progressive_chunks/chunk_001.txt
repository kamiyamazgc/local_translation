Samsung U-turns on ‘ugly’ camera ring with Z Fold 7 – Galaxy S26 next?
Samsung’s new foldable phones will launch soon, and leaks suggest a major design shift. The company reportedly ditched its bold “Saturn Ring” camera design in the Galaxy Z Fold 7; could the Galaxy S26 series follow this change?
A leak from @UniverseIce on X spilled the tea: fans weren’t feeling the thick camera rings, calling them tacky and cheap. Samsung listened and switched back to a sleeker design, more like the Galaxy Z Fold 5’s cleaner look.
New press renders back this claim up. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 features a vertical triple camera setup with slim, polished rings. It’s a nod to Samsung’s push for a classy, minimalist vibe that shouts premium for its foldable segment.
The Galaxy Z Fold 7, launching at Unpacked next month, promises a sleeker look. Early leaks showed a camera with thick, prominent rings, dubbed the “Saturn Ring Design.” This style mirrored the S25 series’ bold camera aesthetic.
The Z Fold 7’s camera redesign also ties into other upgrades. It’s expected to run on the Snapdragon 8 Elite, offering better performance and efficiency. The phone may also feature an 8-inch inner display and a 6.5-inch cover screen.
What about the Galaxy S26 series?
The @UniverseIce leak hints that Samsung might abandon the “Saturn Ring” style for its 2026 flagships. The Galaxy S25 series’ thick camera rings sparked some criticism, so a redesign could be on the horizon next year.
However, details about the Galaxy S26 remain speculative. With its launch expected in early 2026, no solid leaks confirm a camera design change yet. Still, Samsung’s responsiveness to feedback on the Z Fold 7 is a promising sign.

Galaxy S26 Ultra could drop S Pen slot for a reason many fans might support
Thinking of a battery upgrade in Samsung’s next Ultra? Your wish might come true in 2026. Samsung is reportedly considering a battery upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Ultra and beyond, but it would come at the cost of the S Pen slot.
Weibo leaker claims there’s a 50-50 chance that Samsung might abandon the S Pen slot from its future Ultra flagships, probably the Galaxy S26 Ultra. The company is apparently mulling over utilizing this space for battery and practical sensors.
Recently, a report revealed that the Galaxy S27 Ultra may remove the stylus slot. However, the new input suggests that the Galaxy S25 Ultra might render the last Samsung flagship with a built-in S Pen inside the body.
The removal of this silo will prove a boon for Samsung. The phone will have some space vacated that can be used for a battery upgrade, which has been pending for years. Also, more practical sensors would be installed for the user’s benefit.
We expect a 5 to 10% battery capacity boost in case Samsung goes ahead with slot removal in the Galaxy S26 Ultra. The company won’t approach a radical upgrade just to satisfy user demand amid competition from Chinese brands.
Meanwhile, reports also suggest that the Galaxy S26 Ultra might adopt a new S Pen technology. The display will be free of digitizer film, reducing the thickness further. Samsung’s S Pen move with the S25 Ultra already suggested a potential move.
The S Pen of the S25 Ultra doesn’t support Bluetooth features. It’s a major downgrade over the previous S Pen phones, and the company told the real user base is not as much as they would have desired, leading to Bluetooth removal.

Samsung to unveil Tri-Fold phone at July Unpacked, launch in October 2025
Samsung is preparing to reveal its next-generation foldable phones soon. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be launched at Samsung’s big Unpacked event on July 9, 2025. Along with these smartphones, Samsung could unveil its Tri-Fold smartphone at the July Unpacked.
As per a tipster on Weibo, Samsung will introduce its new “Tri-Fold” smartphone at the same event as the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7. This unique phone can fold into three parts, making it more flexible than the Flip or Fold. The device is rumored to be called the Galaxy G Fold.
The Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 phones are expected to be available to buy starting in August 2025. While the Samsung Tri-Fold will likely be shown in July, the actual launch is expected in October 2025.
This approach is similar to how Samsung handled the launch of the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year. This phone was teased at a big event but was released a few months later.
Alongside these devices, Samsung may also tease a new product called Project Moohan, which is an Android XR headset. Like the Tri-Fold, it could also be released around October 2025.
The Galaxy Tri-Fold is already listed on several certification platforms. It is also rumored to share several components similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 7, like the hinge mechanism, speaker drivers, and cutouts. This could help reduce costs and speed up production. Since the Tri-Fold will likely be made in limited quantities, it might be a more exclusive product.
Aside from this, Samsung is now accepting free reservations for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7. If you sign up early, you’ll get a $50 credit, 3X reward points, and up to $1,150 in trade-in savings.

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 look very slim unfolded [Gallery]
A new render leak shows off Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 unfolded. The book-style foldable looks pretty slim when unfolded. The clamshell-type device, meanwhile, has the same sleek design as its predecessor.
Leaker Evan Blass has now shared new renders, which showcase the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 unfolded. The images showcase a thinner design profile from the side view, while the phones are folded or, in other words, unfolded in half.
Galaxy Z Fold 7
The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is said to be just 8.9 mm thick when folded. This measurement brings the unfolded thickness to under 4.5 mm. It’s a significant improvement over the previous model, which is 12.1 mm thick when folded.
With the new Fold, Samsung is gearing up to shake up the foldable market. Chinese OEMs have made remarkable progress in terms of camera, battery, and sleek design in foldable phones, forcing Samsung to rethink its strategy.
Here’s what the Fold 7 looks when unfolded:
Galaxy Z Flip 7
Samsung’s next clamshell foldable brings practical improvements to enhance the user experience. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is said to be 6.9 mm thick when unfolded. Instead of reducing thickness, Samsung has installed a larger battery inside.
In addition, the cover panel is also getting a design boost. The folder icon style cover screen is getting replaced by a full-view OLED. It brings the Flip 7 closer to what the recent Motorola Razr flip phones brought to the table.
Here’s what the Flip 7 looks when unfolded:
Samsung’s 2025 foldables are bringing much-needed design and spec updates. Exynos 2500 is also official, and it’s powering the next Flip phone worldwide. The Fold model, meanwhile, continues the Snapdragon legacy.
The South Korean tech giant is set to launch these devices on July 9 in the US. Preparations are already underway on a massive scale, with Galaxy Experience Spaces also being created at major cities around the world.

Will Samsung eat tariffs to keep Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 price flat in the US?
Samsung is getting ready to launch its new foldable phones on July 9, 2025. The next generation foldables are expected to be thinner and smarter, thanks to improved design. But one big issue getting more attention than anything else is the price of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7, mainly in the US.
There are strong signs that the price of the new Galaxy Z series could go up, especially in the US. This is because of a new plan to bring back tariffs, meaning extra taxes on smartphones made outside the United States.
US President Donald Trump recently said that starting at the end of June, a 25% tariff could be added to phones made in countries like Vietnam and China. Since Samsung makes most of its phones outside the US, this could cause prices to jump for American customers.
At the same time, Samsung is also worried about foldable phone sales going down. Sales of the Galaxy Flip have dropped over the last two years, and experts believe that raising the price could make things worse. In 2023, Galaxy Z Flip 6 sold only 2.89 million units, which is a big drop from 3.66 million the year before.
While the Galaxy Fold 7 may still sell well even with a higher price, many believe the Flip 7 should stay affordable. Some reports say Samsung will use its own chip, the Exynos 2500, in the Flip 7, which may help lower costs.
Samsung wants foldable phones to make up more than 50% of its premium phone sales by 2025. But with tariffs and falling demand, keeping prices reasonable may be the only way to reach that goal.
It will be a major challenge to keep prices affordable for these smartphones, mainly in the US. Samsung is set to launch the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7 soon, and we’ll get the pricing details shortly.

Samsung’s best zoom camera sensors are skipping Galaxy phones
Samsung’s image sensor business is about to boom as Chinese phone makers are allegedly widening the use of ISOCELL zoom camera sensors. That said, the best ISOCELL zoom cameras would be seen on many phones from Chinese OEMs.
While China-based OEMs are expanding the utilization of Samsung’s best zoom camera sensors, Galaxy phones will continue to skip. Exact reasons are unclear, but the biggest is that Galaxy smartphones shouldn’t go bulky like Chinese ones.
Leaker IceUniverse claims that Samsung’s 200-megapixel telephoto cameras will be “widely adopted” in Chinese flagship phones. The devices will be equipped with ISOCELL HP3, ISOCELL HP5, and ISOCELL HP9 telephoto sensors.
Notably, some Chinese flagships already debuted with 200MP zoom sensors from Samsung. Meanwhile, 2025 and beyond years are going to see even broader adoption, heating up the smartphone camera race.
Why Samsung’s best zoom camera sensors are skipping Galaxy phones
Samsung’s best cameras aren’t seen in Galaxy phones is a long unanswered question. The company develops exclusive sensors for Galaxy flagships, but it comes much later than the rivals, who bring at least one or two generations.
No one’s stopping Samsung from equipping phones with modern cameras. However, it will come at a cost: major design shifts. You may have noticed Chinese flagships boast a bulky camera module, which changes drastically each year.
Samsung can’t compromise on Galaxy design philosophy to calm a portion of camera enthusiasts. The company focuses on practical improvements like elevating the photography experience that users love the most with innovative features.
200MP telephoto phones are already here, and it might be a new normal in the future. Meanwhile, the next year’s Galaxy S26 Ultra is rumored to retain almost the same camera specifications as the Galaxy S25 Ultra, leveraging AI.
Well, no one is stopping Samsung from making a limited edition Galaxy phone with monster camera specifications.

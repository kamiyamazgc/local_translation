Hello, this is a test file for the translation functionality.

The local translation system uses LM Studio with the gemma-3n-e4b-it-text model to translate text files from English to Japanese.

This system is designed to:
1. Detect the language of input text
2. Skip translation if the text is already in Japanese
3. Translate English text to Japanese using local LLM
4. Save the translated content to a new file

The translation process is performed locally, ensuring privacy and data security.
